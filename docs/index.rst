ParMOO: Python library for parallel multiobjective simulation optimization
==========================================================================

ParMOO is a Python library for solving multiobjective simulation-based
optimization problems, while exploiting problem structure.

ParMOO stands for "parallel multiobjective optimization".
ParMOO can be used to solve multiobjective optimization problems (MOOPs)
or to generate batches of simulation inputs for parallel evaluation.

If you're new to ParMOO:
